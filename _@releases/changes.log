#####

Dec 15, 2015 :: Version 1.5
	* backward incompatible changes:
		* in the MySQLi driver, the functions read_adata() and read_asdata() have been rotated each other,
			thus the new read_adata() since version 1.5 is now behaving like the old read_asdata() in versions prior to 1.5 ;
			and the new read_asdata() since version 1.5 is now behaving like the old read_adata() in versions prior to 1.5;
			- the new read_adata() since version 1.5: Read Associative Multiple Rows :: returns array(0 => array('column1', 'column2', ... 'column-n'), 1 => array('column1', 'column2', ... 'column-n'), ..., m => array('column1', 'column2', ... 'column-n'))
			- the new read_asdata() since version 1.5: Read Associative Single (one) Rows :: Throws Error if more records are returned by SQL :: returns a single row as array('column1', 'column2', ... 'column-n')
			(this come as a result from many users of these framework to make this function names more easy to remember)
			thus, this will remain finally as it is now since version 1.5
	* optimizations:
		* more than 100 lines of code changed, to speed-up or optimize some areas
		* database drivers: MySQLi, Mongo and Solr are now re-using the connections for the same server:port@db#user
